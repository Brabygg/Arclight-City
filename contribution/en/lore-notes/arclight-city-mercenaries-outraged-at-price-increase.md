>This week, an Arclight City establishment known as Red Bar significantly increased the price of its trademark service. The bar allows customers to, for an additional fee, make discreet contact with others who have reported interest in the service. This has made the establishment highly popular among the city’s mercenaries, who often see it as their primary venue for recruiting a crew.

This has caused outrage with the bar’s customers, many of whom now find themselves without the crew they’re looking for.
